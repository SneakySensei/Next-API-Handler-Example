Create API Routes using apiHandler higher order function for consistency and clean code ðŸ”¥

## Features âš¡

- `res.json()` is called only when we need to send a success response.
- Error responses are handled by apiHandler when we throw an error.
- Controllers are divided into functions and plugged into the API Route by their respective `req.method` which is kind of reminiscent of how Express.js routes are defined.
